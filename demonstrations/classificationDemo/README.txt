%        Getting started with your experiment based on expCode          %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This is short introduction to describe the main component of your
% experiment.

% Please have a look at the Config file. It allows you to set the general
% configuration parameters.

% Next, please have a look at the Modes file. It allows you to set the
% specific parameters that need to be set and tested for every
% configurations of your algorithm under evaluation.

% The evaluation workflow is broken into 3 main steps:
%   Processing
%   Evaluation
%   Display
% For each of those, a specific function has been created that needs to be
% filled.

% The steps can be conviently managed with the Run function.

% More information can be found in the documentation of expCode.
